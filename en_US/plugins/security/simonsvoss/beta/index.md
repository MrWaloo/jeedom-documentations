Locks must communicate.

There are always two types of action 'Normal' or 'With card'. actions with a card allow the lock to be informed that this action and validate via the pass card (this data this action that we will recommend for the access management part).

the normal locks normally for 5sec, so if you do an action (Normal) it is possible that it will not respond until 5 seconds later, on the other hand with a card it will respond immediately (if you pass a card beforehand).
it is possible to listen to this temp via a parameter available on the presentation of the lock).
